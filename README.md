## Talker Manager

Back-end project made while studying at Trybe, a web development school.

The goal of the project was to develop a _CRUD_(Create, Read, Update, Delete) _API_ of speakers using __Node.js__ and __Express__. On this project I created a few endpoints to read and write on a local file, utilizing the _fs_ module.

### Skills Developed

With this project I was able to:

- Make asynchronous operations using callbacks;
- Read and write files locally with _Node.js_;
- Make functions calls in a conscious way;
- Understand the basics of the _Node.js_;
- Understand what is _HTTP_, what is an _API_ and what both have to do with the _Express_;
- Understand the structure of a _Express_ application and how to organize my code;
- Create _Routes_ and apply _Middlewares_.
